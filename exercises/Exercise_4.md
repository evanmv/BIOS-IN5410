Basic plotting
- Make a scatterplot showing the relationship between gene length and count in the data located in "data_file_1.csv". Bonus: Can you change the names of the x and y axes?
- Make a histogram showing the distribution of gene counts.
- Try to add different values for the "breaks = " argument to the hist() function to increase or decrease the number of bins. How does this change the histogram?
